  <h3>SAG Mill (Semi-Autogenous Grinding)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>SAG Mills are large rotating cylinders used primarily in mining operations for semi-autogenous grinding of ores.</li>
    <li>They are critical in processing minerals like gold, copper, and nickel, utilizing both ore and steel balls for efficient grinding.</li>
    <li>SAG mills operate by tumbling the ore material and grinding media inside the mill, effectively breaking down the ore into smaller particles for further processing.</li>
    <li>SAG mills are versatile and can handle a wide range of feed sizes, making them suitable for primary grinding in large-scale mineral processing operations.</li>
    <li>They are often used in conjunction with ball mills and other grinding equipment to achieve optimal grinding efficiency and throughput in mineral processing plants.</li>
