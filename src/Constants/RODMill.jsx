<h3>Rod Mill</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A Rod Mill operates horizontally with steel rods as grinding media, producing a uniform product size and facilitating efficient material reduction in industries such as mining and construction materials.</li>
    <li>Rod mills are particularly effective in breaking down coarse particles and are commonly used in ore processing plants.</li>
    <li>Rod mills use rods of varying lengths and diameters, typically made of high-carbon steel or other durable materials, to grind materials by impact and attrition.</li>
    <li>The rods inside the mill continuously tumble and cascade, effectively grinding the feed material into finer particles.</li>
    <li>Rod mills are versatile and can handle a wide range of feed sizes, making them suitable for both coarse and fine grinding applications.</li>
</ul>
